How simple or comlex does the voting machine need to be? For example how customizable should it be? (How is the client going to use it)

Where are we storing the voting information? Are we updating the server immediately?

Should we have an option for voters to be able to see the results? Before or after they have placed their votes/ the votes are finalized?
