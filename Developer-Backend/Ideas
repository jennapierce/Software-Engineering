Voter table will store all the information user enters while registering

        Password
            Will we need a forgot password or reset password option?
        Sex
        Age
    What other information will we need?
        Do we need users to set a security question? How many?

    Will candidates register themselves? Will they be pre-registered?
    Examples
        Name
        Sex
        Age
        Count
