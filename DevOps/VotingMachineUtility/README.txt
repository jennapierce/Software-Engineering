This voting machine utility script is designed to help you more easily interact with docker

ONLY FOR WINDOWS MACHINES!!

It includes options which allow you to:
Setup a container initially
Start a container
Stop a container
Clear all containers and images

This application also allows the user to see every program required to run the application. 

If you would like to visit the website of the application, go into any command prompt and enter:

docker-machine ip

Copy this ip address, paste it into your browser, and put :8080 right afterwards. 
This should take you into the apache homepage where you can navigate to manager app, then to 
/vote, and see all of the possible pages you can click on and visit. 

Please let me know if you run across any bugs or issues with this application, as so far I have
only tested it on one machine. Email me at huntingtonharton@gmail.com to report any bugs or give feedback.
