Requirements for the voting system
What are system objectives?

Functional
1. Equality of Access -> should allow voters to vote EASILY
2. Easy to  use interface
3. Flexibility -> different types of question formats
4. Accuracy -> count all votes accurately
5. Recounts must be possible
6. Scalability

Democratic system in that only people who are eligible can vote and ensures that they can only vote once
*No voter should be allowed to vote more than the alloted number

2. Reliability -> Should work without loss of data-- especially votes
